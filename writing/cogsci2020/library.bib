	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the development of interactive communication skills in 170 children aged seven to thirteen. Using a communication task that allows extended dialogues between pairs of young speakers, we are able to assess both the overall communicative success achieved by any pair; and from an analysis of the dialogues we can identify several interactive strategies that characterize older and more successful communicators. Successful communication involves the active involvement of both participants: asking and answering questions, volunteering information and responding sensitively to contributions from their partners. In contrast to the process of language acquisition, the development of these interactive skills takes place over an extended time period and subjects vary greatly in their ability to communicate effectively. For many analyses differences in the communicative success achieved by subjects differ more within than between age groups. For example, a substantial minority of our oldest subjects communicate no better than children six years younger},

	Abstract = {In 3 experiments with 98 5-, 6-, 7-, and 9-yr-olds, each child and the experimenter played a game in which one player, the speaker, described one of a set of drawings so that the other, the listener, could pick the matching one from an identical set. When communication failed, the child was asked to ascribe blame to the listener and/or the speaker. No relation was found between ascriptions of blame and inadequacy of the misunderstood message in either Exp I or II. In Exp I, the inadequacy measure was the number of drawings in the set to which a message referred; in Exp II, the inadequacy measure was the percentage of a sample of adults who understood a message. In the 3rd experiment, when a message referred to more than one card, some children were more likely to judge it inadequate when the listener chose the wrong card than when he chose the right one. The frequency of these outcome-centered judgments decreased with age. Results are discussed in terms of developmental changes in the},

	Abstract = {The assumption that language acquisition is relatively independent of the amount and kind of language input must be assessed in light of information about the speech actually heard by young children. The speech of middle-class mothers to 2-year-old children was found to be simpler and more redundant than their speech to 10-year-old children. The mothers modified their speech less when talking to children whose responses they could not observe, indicating that the children played some role in eliciting the speech modifications. Task difficulty did not contribute to the mothers' production of simplified, redundant speech. Experienced mothers were only slightly better than nonmothers in predicting the speech-style modifications required by young children. These findings indicate that children who are learning language have available a sample of speech which is simpler, more redundant, and less confusing than normal adult speech.},
