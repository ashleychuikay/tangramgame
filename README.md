# tangramgame
Parent-child reference game

* `experiments` contains code for three experiments:
  * the original interactive `ref_game` experiment between adults and children
  * the `comprehension` experiment where we asked adults and children to listen to referring expressions produced from the original reference game to assess their transparency to naive listeners
  * the `production` experiment where we asked adults and children to independently produce referring expressions, manipulating the context and familiarity of the items (the `norming` study where adults produced referring expressions for tangrams in isolation was used to choose diagnostic `close` and `far` contexts for this experiment)
* `data` contains anonymized copies of the raw data from each of our experiments
* `writing` contains our manuscript in RMarkdown form, with the final versions of all analyses written in-line
