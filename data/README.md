# Data

* `experiment1` contains interactive reference game data
* `experiment2` contains comprehension data (for kids and adults)
* `experiment3` contains production data (for kids and adults)
* `corpus_data` contains standard age of acquisition datasets 
* `norming` contains data from the norming study used to generate stimuli for experiment 3.

Note that `production/prenorming/pilot_data.csv` used a different set of stimuli before we ran our norming experiment and determined optimally close/far tangram contexts.
